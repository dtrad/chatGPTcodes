# chatGPTcodes
Testing generating code examples by chatGPT.\
One of the outcomes of these tests is to see how can we use chatGPT to learn and teach programming in different languages. 
Although book examples could be technically better, chatGPT has 2 advantages:

1- code is simple and goes straight to the problem asked.\
2- code is often wrong and need to be edited. 

Point 1 above means we have a saying on the example by modifying the questions. Although point 2 above seems a disadvantage, actually this fixing process makes this tool very effective in learning a programming language.

About the examples in this REPO:

In most cases, some minor (or major) editing had to be done after the code was generated. 
More importantly, in some cases for cuda, the output from the transformer was wrong on concept. 
For that I created a version with "wrong" and the end, and the correct solution (edited) without "wrong"
