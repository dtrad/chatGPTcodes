Testing generating code examples by chatGPT.
In some cases, some minor editing had to be done after the code was generated. 
More importantly, in some cases for cuda, the output from the transformer was wrong on concept. 
For that I created a version with "wrong" and the end, and the correct solution (edited) without "wrong"
