Primary waves have one reflection in its travel path, whereas multiple waves have
undergone more than one reflection between source and receiver (Sengbush, 2012).
Multiples can be divided into two general types: surface and internal multiples. Surface
multiples can be extracted and used for marine data because their amplitudes are
strong and can easily overwhelm the internal multiples. As for internal multiples, they
could be a good target for processing land data, precisely for the presence of high- and
low-velocity layers.
Migration is a process that re-locates the seismic events to the true space or time lo-
cation. Because multiple energy can penetrate some subsurface targets where primaries
are weakly focused, migration of multiples is a helpful tool adding to the illumination
of the subsurface.
