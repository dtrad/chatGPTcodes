    "# Matrix multiplication with multithreading\n",
    "This code creates two threads, each of which calculates a portion of the result matrix. The multiply_block function takes three arguments: start and end specify the indices of the rows in the result matrix that should be calculated by the current thread, and result is a reference to the result matrix. The multiply_block function uses nested loops to perform the matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each thread is created using the Thread constructor, and the target function and its arguments are specified as arguments to the constructor. The threads are started using the start method, and the main thread waits for the worker threads to finish using the join method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of how you can use multithreading to perform matrix multiplication in Python, but keep in mind that the performance benefits of multithreading can be limited by the overhead of creating and managing the threads, as well as by the limitations of the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). If you need to perform intensive numerical computations, it may be more efficient to use a lower-level language such as C or Fortran, or to use a library such as numexpr or numba that provides high-performance numerical operations in Python."
