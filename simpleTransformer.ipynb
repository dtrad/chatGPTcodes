    "It has 3 main layers : Embedding layer, transformer layer and a dense layer which is used as a Classifier.\n",
    "This transformer will take an input sequence, pass it through an embedding layer to convert it into a dense representation, then pass it through the transformer layers to perform the self-attention mechanism, and finally pass the output through a dense layer to make a prediction.\n",
    "You can adjust the number of layers, attention heads, and hidden units to suit your specific task, and you can also add other layers like dropout or batch normalization for better performance.\n",
