    "Great question. The term **\"Agents\"** in the context of **Generative AI (GAI)**—especially as used by OpenAI and similar frameworks—is related to, but not the same as, simply sending a request to an LLM with a well-crafted prompt and parameters like temperature, top-k, role, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's the key difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Prompting an LLM**\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single input (or a chat history) with roles (`system`, `user`, `assistant`)\n",
    "* Prompt engineering (writing effective instructions)\n",
    "* Parameters like `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, etc.\n",
    "* No persistent memory or external tool usage (unless manually coded)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **stateless**: each request is independent unless you manually pass conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Agents in GAI (like OpenAI’s GPTs or LangChain Agents)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **LLM + memory + tools + planning + acting**\n",
    "* Capable of **autonomous decision-making**, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Figuring out sub-tasks\n",
    "  * Calling tools/APIs/web searches\n",
    "  * Keeping track of state or objectives\n",
    "* Can use **multi-turn reasoning** and **external actions** (like searching the web or running Python code)\n",
    "* Often built on **frameworks** like LangChain, OpenAI's `function calling`, ReAct, or OpenAI's GPT-based \"Agents\" system\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **stateful** and **autonomous**: it can manage tasks that involve planning, tool use, and remembering context over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prompting an LLM** is like giving a very smart assistant a one-time instruction.\n",
    "* **Using an Agent** is like hiring a capable intern who can:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Understand goals\n",
    "  * Ask clarifying questions\n",
    "  * Use tools like calculators, databases, or browsers\n",
    "  * Keep track of progress over time\n",
    "  * Make decisions along the way\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**No, \"Agents\" is not the same as just prompt engineering with parameters**—it's a more advanced construct that combines LLMs with structured decision-making, memory, and sometimes tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're doing simple prompting with temperature/top-k/roles, you're not yet using Agents—but you can *build* an Agent by combining those capabilities in a structured way.\n"
